# TravAcs — Agent & Developer Guide

> **Read this first.** This is the single entry point for anyone (human or AI agent) picking up
> this project. It gives you complete, verified context so you don't have to guess: what the app
> is, how it's built, where everything lives, the exact commands for every essential operation, and
> the invariants you must not break. Deeper design lives in [`docx/design_travacs.md`](docx/design_travacs.md);
> backend test details in [`firebase/TESTING.md`](firebase/TESTING.md).

## TL;DR
- **TravAcs** is an accessibility-first mobile app that pairs **visually-impaired Users** with
  **verified TravAcsers** (assistants) for **paid in-person travel assistance** (₹149/hr per TravAcser
  serving 1 traveller, ₹210/hr serving 2, + ₹100 travel per TravAcser; min 1-hour bill; see
  [Billing](#firestore-data-model)). **Test phase: only ₹1 is collected at checkout.**
- **Stack:** Flutter (Dart) front end + **Firebase** back end (Phone-OTP Auth, Cloud Firestore,
  Cloud Functions, FCM, Crashlytics). Firebase project: **`travacs-dev`**, functions region
  **`asia-south2`**.
- **Status:** Milestones **M0–M10 are done, checkpointed, and CI-green.** **M11 (Play-Store release)
  is documented but paused** — see [`docx/m11-store-release-plan.md`](docx/m11-store-release-plan.md).
- **Dev machine:** Windows 11 on **ARM64**, corporate-**managed** (no admin). Toolchain is portable
  (paths below). Shell is **PowerShell**.
- **Golden invariant:** users must **never** see raw errors/stack traces, and **accessibility is
  first-class** — see [Golden Rules](#golden-rules-do-not-regress-these).

## First 15 minutes (new agent quickstart)
1. Skim this file top-to-bottom, then [`docx/design_travacs.md`](docx/design_travacs.md) §0–§14.
2. Regenerate the gitignored Firebase config (see [First-time setup](#a-first-time-setup-on-a-fresh-clone)) —
   the app **will not build** without `app/lib/firebase_options.dart`.
3. `cd app; flutter pub get; flutter analyze; flutter test` — expect **82 passing tests**, analyzer clean.
4. Build + install on the connected phone (see [Build & run](#b-build--run-on-the-phone)).
5. Before changing anything, read the [Golden Rules](#golden-rules-do-not-regress-these).

---

## Golden Rules (do NOT regress these)
1. **No raw errors to users — ever.** Every user-facing error message goes through the sealed
   `Failure` taxonomy in `app/lib/core/error/failure.dart` and `mapFirebaseError()` in
   `app/lib/core/error/firebase_error_mapper.dart`. UI surfaces errors via `failureMessage(e)`. Raw
   detail (codes, `toString()`, stack traces) lives **only** in `Failure.debugDetail` and is sent to
   Crashlytics via `error_reporter.dart` — never rendered. There is a global boundary in `main.dart`
   (`FlutterError.onError`, `PlatformDispatcher.onError`, release `ErrorWidget.builder`).
2. **Accessibility is first-class.** Semantic labels on every control; announce status changes
   (`A11y.announce`, `app/lib/core/accessibility/announce.dart`); OTP read digit-by-digit; status is
   **never colour-only** (always text + icon + a `Semantics` label); cards use `MergeSemantics`;
   touch targets ≥48dp; OS text scale is clamped to **[1.0, 1.8]** in `app/lib/app.dart`.
   `test/accessibility_test.dart` guards this with `meetsGuideline`.
3. **Privileged writes are server-only.** Clients can NOT set `role`, `verificationStatus`,
   `ratingAvg/ratingCount`, `volunteerId`, or amounts. Trips start when the TravAcser validates the
   User's deterministic **offline start-code** (`startTrip`); billing anchors to the recorded
   `startedAt`. All state transitions (accept → start → end → reschedule → cancel → pay → rate →
   verify) go
   through **Cloud Functions** (Admin SDK) and
   are enforced by **Firestore Security Rules** (`firebase/firestore.rules`).
4. **Work milestone-by-milestone; checkpoint each.** Create a branch `master_m<n>` per milestone and
   push it. See [Milestone history](#milestone-history).
5. **Never commit secrets/config.** `firebase_options.dart`, `google-services.json`,
   `key.properties`, `*.jks`/`*.keystore`, and the root helper `*.js` scripts are **gitignored** —
   regenerate them locally, don't commit.
6. **Run the quality gates before committing:** `flutter analyze` (clean) + `flutter test` (green).
   Backend changes also need the emulator tests (see [Cookbook §D](#d-backend-tests-firestore-emulator)).

## Architecture & approach

**Layered (Clean-ish) architecture:** `presentation → domain ← data`. The `domain` layer is pure
Dart (entities + repository **interfaces**); `data` implements those interfaces with Firebase SDKs;
`presentation` (Riverpod) depends only on the interfaces. This keeps the app testable offline.

- **Result type:** repositories return `FutureResult<T>` = `Future<Either<Failure, T>>` (fpdart).
  Helpers `success(v)` / `failure(f)` in `core/error/result.dart`. UI/controllers `.fold`/`.match`
  on the result; they never `try/catch` Firebase directly.
- **State management:** **Riverpod 3**. `Provider`s wire repositories; `StreamProvider`/`FutureProvider`
  expose live data; `Notifier`-based `*_controller.dart` drive actions and hold `AsyncValue<void>`.
- **Routing:** **go_router** with a Riverpod-aware redirect in `app/lib/core/router/app_router.dart`.
  Routes: `/splash`, `/auth/phone`, `/auth/otp?phone=…`, `/complete-profile`, `/home` (role shell),
  `/admin`. Redirect gate: not signed-in → `/auth/phone`; signed-in **admin claim** → `/admin`
  (skips profile gate); signed-in non-admin with **no profile** → `/complete-profile`; otherwise
  → `/home`. It listens to `authStateChangesProvider`, `isAdminProvider`, `myProfileProvider`.

### Providers (read deps) — `app/lib/presentation/providers/`
| Provider | Type | Exposes |
|---|---|---|
| `firebaseAuthProvider`, `firestoreProvider`, `firebaseReadyProvider` | Provider | Firebase singletons (overridable in tests) |
| `authStateChangesProvider` | StreamProvider | current uid (null = signed out) |
| `isAdminProvider` | FutureProvider | admin custom-claim check |
| `myProfileProvider` | FutureProvider | `MyProfile?` (null = registration incomplete) |
| `myRequestsProvider` | StreamProvider | requester's own requests |
| `myAssignmentsProvider` | StreamProvider | TravAcser's accepted trips (collectionGroup) |
| `availableRequestsProvider` | StreamProvider | open requests in the TravAcser's city, minus already-accepted (empty unless approved + city set) |
| `requestAssignmentsProvider` | StreamProvider.family | per-request assignments (requester's view) |
| `pendingVolunteersProvider` | StreamProvider | admin: volunteers awaiting verification |
| `functionsProvider` | Provider | `FirebaseFunctions.instanceFor(region: 'asia-south2')` |

### Controllers (actions) — `*_controller.dart`
`authControllerProvider` (requestOtp/verifyOtp/signOut) · `profileControllerProvider`
(save/setServiceArea/setAvailability) · `requestControllerProvider` (create/cancel/accept/reschedule/
cancelTrip/completeTrip/markPaid/markReceived/submitRating) · `adminControllerProvider` (approve/reject).

### Repositories — interface in `domain/repositories/`, impl in `data/repositories/`
- **AuthRepository** → `FirebaseAuthRepository`: Phone-OTP (`verifyPhoneNumber` bridged to a Future),
  `isAdmin()` from ID-token claims. Auth SDK only.
- **ProfileRepository** → `FirestoreProfileRepository`: single doc `profiles/{uid}`; first write sets
  immutable fields (role, verificationStatus, ratings); updates merge editable fields only.
- **RequestRepository** → `FirestoreRequestRepository`: creates `requests`, streams via queries +
  `collectionGroup('assignments')`; **all state transitions call Cloud Functions callables**.
- **AdminRepository** → `FirestoreAdminRepository`: streams pending volunteers; `setVerification`
  via callable.

### Domain entities — `app/lib/domain/entities/`
- `Request` — request details; **static** billing helpers: `billedHours(min)` (min 1 h + per-hour
  rounding ≤14→0/15–40→+0.5/41–60→+1), `computeEstimate(min, numTravellers, numTravAcsers)` =
  `billedHours × (pair×₹210 + solo×₹149) + ₹100×numTravAcsers` (pair = TravAcsers serving 2 people),
  `suggestedTravAcsers(travellers)` = `(t+1)~/2`; getters `slotsRemaining`, `isFull`.
- `Profile`/`RequesterProfile`/`VolunteerProfile`/`MyProfile`; `Assignment` (per-TravAcser trip +
  payment + ratings); `PendingVolunteer`.
- `enums.dart` — `UserRole` (requester/volunteer/admin; **labels are "User"/"TravAcser"** while wire
  values stay `requester`/`volunteer`), `RequestStatus`, `TripStatus`, `PaymentStatus`,
  `VerificationStatus`, `Gender`, `Region` (Delhi NCR + states/UTs).
- `city.dart` — curated `City` list; matching key is the **city** `wireValue`.

## Backend (Firebase)

### Firestore data model
| Path | Written by | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles/{uid}` | client (editable) + functions (protected) | role, fullName, gender?, dateOfBirth?, phone?, isActive, serviceArea, serviceCity, ratingAvg, ratingCount; **volunteer:** address?, verificationStatus, verifiedBy?, rejectionReason?; **requester:** homeLocationText? |
| `requests/{id}` | client create; functions transition | requesterId, status, serviceArea, serviceCity, numTravellers, numTravAcsers, acceptedCount, genderPreference, scheduledDate, startTime, **scheduledStartAt** (schedule/billing anchor), expectedDurationMinutes, meetingPoint, destination, estimatedAmountInr, … |
| `requests/{id}/assignments/{volunteerId}` | **functions only** | contact pair, denormalized summary (incl. genderPreference, scheduledStartAt), tripStatus (assigned/started/completed/closed/cancelled), startedAt/endedAt, durationMinutes, amountInr, paymentStatus, requesterPaidAt/travAcserReceivedAt, ratings |
| `devices/{uid}/tokens/{token}` | client (self) | FCM tokens |
| `ratings/{id}`, `trips/{id}` | (rules present; ratings are primarily stored on the assignment) | audit/future use |

> **No SMS OTP / `secrets` subcollection** — trip start uses a deterministic **offline** start-code
> both apps compute from the shared assignment (`app/lib/core/util/trip_otp.dart`); the User reads it
> to the TravAcser, who enters and validates it, and `startTrip` records the flip (both are notified).

**Rules helpers** (`firebase/firestore.rules`): `isSignedIn()`, `isAdmin()` (`token.admin==true`),
`isApprovedVolunteer()` (role volunteer + approved + active), `myCity()`. Requests are **region-scoped**
(an approved TravAcser sees only `broadcast` requests where `serviceCity == myCity()`). The requester
can only **cancel before any accept** (client-side); `assignments`/`trips` are **function-only writes**.
A **collection-group** rule (`match /{path=**}/assignments/{vid}`) lets a TravAcser list their own
assignments — it gates on `resource.data.volunteerId == request.auth.uid` (a doc-id check errors during
a list, since the path wildcard is null then).

### Cloud Functions — `firebase/functions/src/index.ts` (callables region `asia-south2`)
Trips **start when the TravAcser validates the User's deterministic offline start-code** (computed on
both clients from the shared assignment — `app/lib/core/util/trip_otp.dart`; the User reads it to the
TravAcser, who enters it, and `startTrip` records the flip). Scheduled functions run in `asia-south1`
(Cloud Scheduler isn't offered in `asia-south2`).
| Function | Type | What it does / key guards |
|---|---|---|
| `onRequestCreated` | Firestore onCreate `requests/{id}` | Fan-out FCM (chunked to 500/token) to approved+active TravAcsers in the same city; prunes dead tokens. |
| `acceptRequest` | onCall | FCFS slot fill in a transaction: must be approved+active TravAcser, request `broadcast` + same city + not full + not already accepted; creates the assignment (denormalizing genderPreference + scheduledStartAt); auto-transitions request to `assigned` when full. Rejects a second accepted trip on the same IST day. |
| `startTrip` | onCall | **TravAcser-only**; after the TravAcser enters and validates the User's start code, flips `assigned`→`started` (guarded to on/after the scheduled time) and records `startedAt`; notifies the User. |
| `completeTrip` | onCall | End a **started** trip — caller = TravAcser **or** requester; bills from the recorded `startedAt`; marks `completed`; marks the request completed when no active assignment remains. |
| `rescheduleTrip` | onCall | **Requester-only**, before start; validates a bounded future time; updates the request + all assignments' schedule and requires each TravAcser to re-confirm. |
| `cancelTrip` | onCall | Either party. Requester → cancels the whole request + assignments. TravAcser → cancels their assignment, decrements `acceptedCount`, reopens the request to `broadcast`. |
| `markPaid` / `markReceived` | onCall | Two-sided payment state machine (`pending`→`awaiting_other`→`confirmed`). `markPaid` is requester-only. |
| `submitRating` | onCall | Mutual 1–5 rating after `completed`; updates the ratee's rolling `ratingAvg`/`ratingCount`; blocks duplicates. |
| `setVerification` | onCall | **Admin-claim only**; approves/rejects a TravAcser; pushes the result. |

## Milestone history
Branch-per-milestone; all pushed to `origin`. `master_old` preserves the original **Supabase**
implementation (the backend was migrated to Firebase early for India phone-OTP without DLT/SMS-gateway
friction).

| Milestone | Shipped | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|
| M0–M2 | Firebase foundations, Firestore model + Rules + Phone Auth, profiles/registration + role shell | (folded into early history) |
| M3 | Requests + broadcast + FCM fan-out (`onRequestCreated`); Blaze plan enabled | `master_m3` |
| M4 | FCFS slot-filling accept (transaction) + contact exchange + per-TravAcser OTP | `master_m4` |
| M5 | Trip start (OTP) → complete → per-TravAcser billing | `master_m5` |
| M6 | Two-sided payment + mutual ratings | `master_m6` |
| M7 | Admin verification (`setVerification` + admin screen) | `master_m7` |
| **M8** | **Graceful error handling** — Failure taxonomy, mapper, stream mapping, global boundary, Crashlytics; users never see raw errors | `master_m8` |
| **M9** | **Accessibility pass** — text-scale clamp, status-not-colour-only, MergeSemantics, announcements, `meetsGuideline` tests | `master_m9` |
| **M10** | **Automated tests** — M10a 53 offline tests; M10b 25 rules + 10 functions emulator tests; M10c GitHub Actions CI | `master_m10`, `master_m10a/b/c` |
| **M11** | **Store-release prep (Android)** — **PLANNED, PAUSED.** See `docx/m11-store-release-plan.md`. | — |
| **M12** | **Feature-completion / gap-fill** — fixed the collection-group rules bug (My Trips), built real History tabs (replacing placeholders), made the active-trip lifecycle first-class, **removed OTP** (trips auto-start at `scheduledStartAt`; either party ends), added **reschedule** (User) + **cancel** (both sides), and redesigned the request form (gender-preference dropdown, TravAcser slider, dropped landmark + male/female split). | `master_m12` |
| **M13** | **App menu** — centralized the AppBar in the shell with a navigation **Drawer** (`presentation/features/menu/`): Contact us, About (built-in `showAboutDialog`), Rate-us (placeholder), Terms, Privacy, Sign out + a dismiss button. Placeholder info screens; client-only (no deploy). | `master_m13` |
| **M14** | **A11y label + control fixes** — icon-only buttons now set `Icon(semanticLabel:)` (tooltip alone isn't read as the TalkBack name); removed a merging `Semantics` wrapper on the request-form stepper; replaced the broken TravAcser **slider** with an accessible **1–10 dropdown** (decoupled from traveller count). Client-only. | `master_m14` |

> Note: `docx/design_travacs.md` §17 uses an older roadmap numbering; the **branches above are the
> authoritative record** of what actually shipped.
>
> M12 removed the SMS OTP (trips then auto-started by time). A later enhancement batch reintroduced
> trip start as a **deterministic offline start-code** (`startTrip` + `app/lib/core/util/trip_otp.dart`):
> the User reads their code to the TravAcser, who enters and validates it, and billing anchors to the
> confirmed `startedAt`. The same
> batch added **in-app Razorpay payment**, one-trip-per-day, request auto-expiry, reschedule confirm/cancel, and
> admin dashboards. Scheduled functions run in `asia-south1`; callables in `asia-south2`.
>
> **Razorpay is LIVE.** Credentials live only in **Firebase Secret Manager** (secrets
> `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, never in the repo). `createRazorpayOrder` +
> `verifyRazorpayPayment` (both `asia-south2`) read them and hand the client the `keyId` at runtime —
> the Key Secret never leaves the server. Rotating keys = `firebase functions:secrets:set <NAME>
> --project travacs-dev --data-file <tmp>` then redeploy those two functions. A later gap-fill added
> **started-trip lock** (a `started` trip can't be cancelled/rescheduled, and can't be ended before
> `scheduledStartAt`) and **gender-matched broadcast** (only `strict_same_gender` requests are hidden
> from opposite-gender TravAcsers until the last 10% of lead time, then auto-widened by the scheduled
> `widenGenderRequests`).

## Environment & toolchain (this dev machine)
Windows 11 **ARM64**, corporate-managed (**no admin**; MSI installers blocked). Everything is a
portable ZIP install. Shell is **PowerShell**.

| Tool | Path / value |
|---|---|
| Flutter SDK | `C:\Users\sauprasad\develop\flutter` (`flutter` is on PATH) |
| Dart SDK | bundled with Flutter; `environment: sdk: ^3.7.2` |
| Portable JDK 17 | `C:\Users\sauprasad\dev-tools\jdk17\jdk-17.0.19+10` |
| Android SDK | `C:\Users\sauprasad\dev-tools\android-sdk` |
| adb | `C:\Users\sauprasad\dev-tools\android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe` |
| Node / npm | Node 22 / npm 10.9 on PATH |
| Firebase CLI | global `firebase` (v15); logged in as `saurabhprasad20@gmail.com` |
| Test phone | `M2010J19CI` (Xiaomi/MIUI, Android 12), adb id **`171a26b21220`** |

Key build values (from `app/android/app/build.gradle.kts` + `settings.gradle.kts`):
`applicationId`/`namespace` = **`com.travacs.travacs`**, **minSdk 23**, **ndkVersion 27.0.12077973**,
**Kotlin 2.2.0**, **AGP 8.7.0**. Firebase project **`travacs-dev`** (number `376835689559`), functions
**Node 20**, region **`asia-south2`**.

**Gotchas to know:**
- **Gitignored config must be regenerated** before building (see below) — `firebase_options.dart`
  and `google-services.json` are not in the repo.
- **Firebase emulator needs Java**, but the global `firebase-tools` v15 requires **Java 21+** while
  this machine has **JDK 17**. Workaround: pin **`npx -y firebase-tools@13`** for emulator commands
  (it accepts Java 17). CI uses JDK 21 + latest firebase-tools instead.
- **MIUI** blocks `adb install` unless "Install via USB" is enabled (needs a Mi account); tap-installing
  the APK from a file also works. `install -r` worked in the last session.
- **Long commands run in the foreground** — background shell commands get killed on this machine.

---

## Command cookbook
All commands are **PowerShell**. Working directory matters — each block says where to run it.
Where a command touches the Android build or the emulator, set `JAVA_HOME` first (shown inline).

### A. First-time setup (on a fresh clone)
```powershell
# 1) Firebase config (writes the gitignored app/lib/firebase_options.dart + android google-services.json)
#    Requires: `firebase login` and the FlutterFire CLI (`dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`).
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\app
flutterfire configure --project=travacs-dev

# 2) Flutter deps
flutter pub get

# 3) Backend deps (only needed to run the emulator test suites)
npm install --prefix C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\firebase\functions
npm install --prefix C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\firebase\rules-tests
```

### B. Build & run on the phone
```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Users\sauprasad\dev-tools\jdk17\jdk-17.0.19+10"
$env:PATH      = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\app

# Build a release APK (currently DEBUG-signed — release signing is M11)
flutter build apk --release        # -> build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk (~50 MB)

# Refresh the shareable copy at repo root
Copy-Item build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk ..\TravAcs.apk -Force

# Install + launch on the connected phone
$adb = "C:\Users\sauprasad\dev-tools\android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe"
& $adb -s 171a26b21220 install -r ..\TravAcs.apk
& $adb -s 171a26b21220 shell monkey -p com.travacs.travacs -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1

# OR, for a dev session that builds+installs+launches+attaches:
flutter run -d 171a26b21220
```
Useful: `flutter devices` (list connected devices), `& $adb devices` (raw adb list).

### C. Quality gates (offline, fast)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\app
flutter analyze        # must be clean (no issues)
flutter test           # 82 tests: domain, repository, provider, widget_flow, error_mapper, accessibility
flutter test test/domain_test.dart   # run a single file
```

### D. Backend tests (Firestore emulator)
Run from `firebase/`. These spin up the Firestore emulator, run the suite, and shut it down.
```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Users\sauprasad\dev-tools\jdk17\jdk-17.0.19+10"
$env:PATH      = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\firebase

# Security Rules tests (25)
npx -y firebase-tools@13 emulators:exec --only firestore --project demo-travacs `
  "npm --prefix rules-tests test"

# Cloud Functions tests (10)
npx -y firebase-tools@13 emulators:exec --only firestore --project demo-travacs `
  "npm --prefix functions test"
```
(`--project demo-travacs` uses a demo project so no real credentials are touched. The
`firebase-tools@13` pin is the JDK-17 workaround — see Gotchas. Full notes in `firebase/TESTING.md`.)

### E. Build & deploy the backend (production = `travacs-dev`)
Run from `firebase/`. Functions require the **Blaze** billing plan. There is no `.firebaserc`, so
always pass `--project travacs-dev`.
```powershell
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs\firebase

# Compile the functions (also runs automatically as a predeploy step)
npm --prefix functions run build

firebase deploy --only functions --project travacs-dev            # all functions
firebase deploy --only functions:acceptRequest --project travacs-dev  # one function
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project travacs-dev      # security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore --project travacs-dev            # rules + indexes
```

### F. Admin / setup helpers (root, gitignored, run with Node)
These read your existing `firebase login` session. For **local testing/bootstrap only**.
```powershell
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs
node make_admin.js +9198XXXXXXXX   # grant the `admin` custom claim (E.164 phone); user must re-login
node approve_volunteer.js          # approve the hardcoded test TravAcser (+918178796516)
node enable_phone.js               # enable Phone Auth + register test numbers
```
Test phone numbers (Firebase test OTP): `+918979515501` and `+918178796516`, code **`123456`**.

### G. Git / checkpoint workflow
```powershell
cd C:\Users\sauprasad\travacs\TravAcs
# work on master; at the end of a milestone, checkpoint it:
git branch master_m<n>
git push -u origin master_m<n>
git push origin master
```

## CI — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
Runs on every push + PR. Two jobs:
- **flutter-tests** — writes a stub `firebase_options.dart` (the real one is gitignored), then
  `flutter pub get` → `flutter analyze` → `flutter test`.
- **backend-tests** — sets up **JDK 21** + latest `firebase-tools`, `npm ci`, then `emulators:exec`
  for the rules (25) and functions (10) suites.

"Green" = both jobs pass. There's no `gh` CLI on the dev machine; check runs via the GitHub web UI or
the public Actions API.

## Known gaps & next work
- **M11 (Play-Store release) — paused.** Critical blockers documented in
  `docx/m11-store-release-plan.md`: (a) release build still uses the **debug signing key**;
  (b) **`INTERNET` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` are only in the debug/profile manifests, not the main
  `AndroidManifest.xml`** — a *release* build would have **no network** and no FCM on Android 13+.
  Also: default launcher icon, no R8/minify, Crashlytics Gradle plugin not applied.
- **Deferred on-device passes:** the M8 error-handling runtime check (airplane mode, full-slot
  accept, denied permission, forced crash → friendly fallback) and the M9 TalkBack end-to-end pass
  were never run on a physical device. Also re-verify the full trip flow on-device
  (create → accept → start via offline code → end → pay → rate; reschedule; cancel from both sides).
- **Functions runtime:** Node 20 is deprecated (decommission 2026-10-30) — bump `engines.node` to 22
  and redeploy when convenient.
- **Deferred review findings (documented known gaps):**
  - *Offline start-code has no true physical-presence guarantee* — both parties can compute the
    deterministic code without meeting. Kept intentionally (offline, no SMS). Harden later with a
    server-issued one-time code if presence assurance becomes a requirement.
  - *One-trip-per-day has a theoretical race* — two same-user accepts within milliseconds could both
    pass the collection-group check (practically impossible via the single-tap UI). A robust fix is a
    deterministic guard doc (`volunteerDailySlots/{uid_ISTdate}`) claimed/released on
    accept/cancel/reschedule.
  - *Partial multi-TravAcser lifecycle* — a partially-filled request stays `broadcast`; starting one
    assignment doesn't freeze the remaining slots, and some complete+cancel combinations don't cleanly
    reconcile the parent status. Needs a focused lifecycle rework.
- **Next planned step:** on-device E2E of the **live Razorpay** payment flow (end trip → order →
  checkout → verify → paid) with a small real transaction, then continue iterating on the trip
  lifecycle; M11 store-release remains paused.
